xnotify
=======

xnotify is a filesystem event based developer workflow automation daemon.
It keeps track of configured directories and runs templated scripts based on event type.
For example, a `directory` `create` event can trigger a script to configure that new directory for event monitoring.
Similarly, a `file` `update` event can trigger a script to write a git commit for that update.
